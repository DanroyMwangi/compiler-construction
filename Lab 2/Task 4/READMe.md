# Simple Calculator Parser using YACC and Flex

This task demonstrates how to create a simple calculator parser using YACC (Yet Another Compiler Compiler) and Flex. The parser can handle basic arithmetic expressions with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

## Files Description

- `calculator.y`: This file contains the grammar rules and actions for the parser. It specifies how expressions are parsed and evaluated.

- `calculator.l`: This file defines the lexical rules using Flex. It tokenizes the input and generates tokens for the parser. :)

- `lex.yy.c`: This file is generated by FlexðŸ’ª and contains the C code for the lexical analyzer (lexer). To generate this file run : `flex <filename>`

- `y.tab.c` and `y.tab.h`: These files are generated by YACC and contain the C code for the parser. `y.tab.c` is the main parser code, and `y.tab.h` contains token definitions.To generate this file run : `yacc <filename>`

- `Makefile`: This file provides instructions for building the parser using the `make` command.

## Instructions

1. **Generate Parser Files**:

   - Run the following command to generate the parser files from `calculator.y`:
     ```
     yacc -d calculator.y
     ```

2. **Generate Lexical Analyzer**:

   - Run the following command to generate the lexical analyzer code from `calculator.l`:
     ```
     flex calculator.l
     ```

3. **Compile the Parser**:

   - Use the `Makefile` or run the following command to compile the parser and generate the executable:
     ```
     gcc lex.yy.c y.tab.c -o calculator
     ```

4. **Run the Calculator**:

   - Execute the following command to run the calculator program:
     ```
     ./calculator
     ```

5. **Input Arithmetic Expressions**:

   - The calculator accepts arithmetic expressions with numbers, addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), division (/), and parentheses ().

6. **Example**:
   - Input: `2 + 3 * (4 - 1)`
   - Output: `Result: 11`
