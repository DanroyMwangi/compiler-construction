2. Use flex to convert the `.l` file to by running the command `flex -o name_of_lexer.yy.c name_of_l_file.l`
3. Output the lexical analyzer using the command `gcc -o name_of_lexical_analyzer lexer.yy.c -lfl`
4. Run the output from 3 above to test out the lexical analyzer that has been generated as a bash script.
